Compilation of server and client files:
gcc server.c -o server.out
gcc client.c -o client.out
Running server and client files. There are two modes in which we can run:

Mode_error = 0  for client means that client is working fine and will send correct packets
Mode_error = 1 for client means that client will send first packet correct and rest 4 will send wrong packets
./client.out localhost 9999 0
./client.out localhost 9999 1

Mode_error = 0  for server means that server will be working fine and will send response if packet is received.
Mode_error = 1 for server will not send acknoledgment this is to validate timeout and retransmission

./server.out 9999 0
./server.out 9999 1
